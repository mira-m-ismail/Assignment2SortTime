Calling quick sort while passing sorted arrays results in a recursion error in the quick sort algorithm,
meaning it keeps calling itself until maximum recursion was reached by Python. This can be due to the lack of
a base case that can tell it to stop recursion (return nothing), if an array is already sorted.
